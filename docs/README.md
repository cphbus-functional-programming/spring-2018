# Assignments
These are the assignments you will have to hand in during the course:

| Assignment number | Theme |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1 | [RPN Calculator](https://github.com/cphbus-functional-programming/spring-2018/blob/master/docs/slides/01%20Assignment.pdf) |
| 2 | **[Tail recursion and the virtual CPU](https://github.com/cphbus-functional-programming/spring-2018/blob/master/docs/slides/02%20Assignment.pdf)** |
| 3 | **Map and flatmap** in Lisp |
| 4 | Elm REST |
| 5 | **Elm Websocket** chat *client* |
| 6 | [Haskell application](https://github.com/cphbus-functional-programming/spring-2018/blob/master/docs/slides/06%20Assignment.pdf)
| 7 | **Parallel Haskell webserver** |
| 8 | Full stack  with support for the chat protocol in assignment 6 |

The assignments in **bold** are mandatory and is **required** to attend the exam.

Assignments will be elaborated as the course progresses. Assignments from previous classes
can be [found at GitHub](https://github.com/cphbus-functional-programming), but *do not* assume
that they will be the same in this course.

## Study points
To attend the exam, you **need at least 80% of total number of** study points. Study points
are given for your hand-ins and *not* for class attendance.

Remember that the assignments above in **bold** are mandatory and is **required** to attend the exam.

# Exam
You will be examinated orally. You will have to present one of the four major assignments (marked in bold above). So out of the four assignments, you have to pick one. From there we will have a discussion about the course content. You have **10 minutes** to present your assignment. Then we will ask you questions for around 7-10 minutes. We will naturally ask into other topics, but the presentation will be the starting point.

The questions for the exams will be published. An example from 2017 can be found here: [https://github.com/cphbus-functional-programming/general/blob/master/exam.md](https://github.com/cphbus-functional-programming/general/blob/master/exam.md)
